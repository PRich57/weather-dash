# Weather Dash

## Description

Weather Dash aims to provide the user with a free and easy-to-use weather application. The app will display the current weather and a 5-day forecast of any city the user would like to view. This web application was designed to maximize viewing comfort on mobile and desktop browsers.

View the 5-day forecast in any city, complete with average daily temperatures, high temperatures, wind speeds, and humidity.
The easily accessible search history list allows users to get updates on the weather in cities they've recently viewed without the need to search again.

## Installation

N/A

## Usage

To use Weather Dash, enter the name of a city to view the current weather and 5-day forecast for that city. The input field is not case-sensitive but requires the city's name to be spelled correctly to display the weather.

For each city searched, the Search History field will update with the most recent ten searches, beginning with the most recent at the top of the list. The user may click on any of the buttons in the search history list to display that city's weather again. When the user has searched more than ten times, the oldest search will be removed from the bottom of the list to maintain a maximum of 8 items in the search history at a time.
