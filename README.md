## Usage

To use this weather dashboard, enter the name of a city to view the current weather and 5 day forecast for that city. The input field is not case sensitive but does require the name of the city to be spelled correctly in order to display the weather.

For each city searched by the user, the Search History field will update with the most recent 8 searches, beginning with the most recent at the top of the list. The user may click on any of the buttons in the search history list to display that city's weather again. When the user has searched more than 8 times, the oldest search will be removed from the bottom of the list to maintain a maximum of 8 items in the search history at a time.
